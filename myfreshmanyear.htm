<h1> My Freshman Year (So Far)</h1>
<img src="bryant.jpg" alt="Bryant University Logo" width="250" height="250">
<h2> First Semester </h2>
I started my college career at Bryant University in Smithfield RI. There I studies International Business
with a concentration in accounting and a minor in italian. not only was this my first time
truely away from home but it was also my first time moving. There I learned what it really took 
to make the jump from High School to college. Amoung the many things that I learned there 
in the classroom I also learned alot about myself and what I was looking for in  a college. The most 
important things I learned were: 
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><h3>There's more to a school than what their "national ranking" is</h3></li>
in the process of picking a college I focused way too much on what other people
think of the school.
<li><h3>The grass isn't always greener on the other side</h3></li>
When I was deciding between where to go I told myself that I had to get out of Maine, 
even though I had never experienced anything else. Once I was away I realized how 
lucky I was to grow up in such a beautiful place and that being near the city isn't as
great as it sounds. 
<li><h3>Smaller isn't always better</h3></li>
Being in classes of 15-25 people is great for indivdual attention, but it just wasn't for me.
Being at the University of Maine has taught me that the quality of the instructor far outweighs 
having less students. 
<li><h3>College is EXPENSIVE</h3></li>
I think that this one is pretty self explanitory. 
<li><h3>Just because I have time to mess around, doesn't mean I should.</h3></li>
With all the extra free time it's easy to choose to go out with friends or 
spend more time at the gym. As I learned quickly, you can tell who uses 
their time wisely and for those who don't school is much harder.
<li><h3>The importance of keeping a schedule</h3></li>
I rarely used an agenda or a planner in high school. Now that classes are only 
two or three days a week it's much easier to forget. 
<li><h3>Don't start the homework the night before</h3></li>
For the first half semester I found my self constanly giving up sleep to finish 
assignments. After a few sleepless nights in a row I had my light buld moment
and realized that if I spaced my work out I could actually finish well ahead of 
the deadline and not have to stress.
<li><h3>Find positive uses for your time</h3></li>
I've brushed over this a couple times above but in college you can choose to be 
invloved, or you can choose to do nothing. I'm not saying there is anything wrong 
with doing nothing but personally, I found that keeping my self busy with activities 
made me feeling so much happier than spend 18 hours a day in tiny dorm room.   
<li><h3>There is so much out there! Do things you wouldn't normally do</h3></li>
While I was at Bryant I was able to experience and meet people from many
different cultures. If it weren't for going out of my comfort zone and trying 
new things I wouldn't be the person I am now.
<li><h3>Most importantly <b> Have Fun!</b> </h3></li>
Doing school work is important and shouldn't be compromised,  but theses are the 
best years of my life and I should go enjoy them. 
</ul>
<h2> Second Semester</h2> 
<img src="umo.jpg" alt="University of Maine" width="250" height="250"><br>
After realizing that Bryant University was were I wanted to be, I came to the 
University of Maine. Though I've only been here half a semester I know that 
this is the place for me. Coming here made me feel at home while also being 
in an academic environment where I'm honestly excited to learn and feel challenged.
This assignment is a great microcosm for my feelings tword UMaine. I've also 
been interest in computers and I took a low level coding class in high school, 
with this assignment, I'm able to learn a real world skill that I could build on and 
use toward my future</center>
