<h1> Adventures </h1>

As someone who grew up in Maine I know first hand how beautiful this state truely 
is. From a young age I was always encouraged to get out and be active. Here are 
just a few of my favorite spots that I've gotten to vist in and around the state of Maine
and New Hampshire.<br>

<h2>Portland Headlight</h2>
Portland Headlight; at one time a naval base, has been demilitarised and is one of the most 
popular tourist attractions in the greater Portland area. <br>

<h2>Old Port, Portland </h2>
Portlands most popular tourist attraction, the Old Port is home to many upscale boutiques and 
resturants along with the port authority where cruise ships are constently coming and 
going during the warmer months. <br>

<h2>Glen Ellis Falls</h2>
Located just off the highway, Glen Ellis Falls is a true hidden gem. In the summer it becomes 
quite the tourist destination, especially on warm days. If you go at the right time you can even 
swim into the falls (be sure to check the water temps before you go).<br>

<h2>Tumbledown Moutain</h2>
Whats better than a moutian with 360 degree breath taking views? That same mountain having 
a lake on top! That is exactly what Tumbledown has to offer, but don't be fooled. To get this 
beautiful view and lake you have to climb (at some points literally) a mile and a half of rocky
vertical terrain. For those with the endurance the time is definitely well spent. <br>

<h2> Castine Maine </h2>
Castine Maine is not only home to Maine Maritime academy but also colonial style 
houses and beautiful ocean views. This picture was taken off of the Training ship state of Maine , 
as I'm sure you could tell from it's namesake this ship is used to train students before most go on to 
persue careers in the private maritime sector.
